Note that this is an old element, that was written\nbefore all modern browsers had non-prefixed flex styles. As such, nowadays you\ndon't really need to use this element anymore, and can use CSS flex styles\ndirectly in your code.\n\nThis component provides two different ways to use flexbox:\n\n1. [Layout\nclasses](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nThe layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules,\nthat let you specify layout properties directly in markup. You must include this\nfile in every element that needs to use them.\n\n    Sample use:\n\n    ```\n    <custom-element-demo>\n      <template>\n        <script src=\"../webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js\"></script>\n        <next-code-block></next-code-block>\n      </template>\n    </custom-element-demo>\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    import {html} from '@polymer/polymer/lib/utils/html-tag.js';\n    import '@polymer/iron-flex-layout/iron-flex-layout-classes.js';\n\n    const template = html`\n      <style is=\"custom-style\" include=\"iron-flex iron-flex-alignment\"></style>\n      <style>\n        .test { width: 100px; }\n      </style>\n      <div class=\"layout horizontal center-center\">\n        <div class=\"test\">horizontal layout center alignment</div>\n      </div>\n    `;\n    document.body.appendChild(template.content);\n    ```\n\n2. [Custom CSS\nmixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html).\nThe mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS\nrule using the `@apply` function.\n\nPlease note that the old [/deep/ layout\nclasses](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/classes)\nare deprecated, and should not be used. To continue using layout properties\ndirectly in markup, please switch to using the new `dom-module`-based\n[layout\nclasses](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nPlease note that the new version does not use `/deep/`, and therefore requires\nyou to import the `dom-modules` in every element that needs to use them.\n\n@group Iron Elements\n@pseudoElement iron-flex-layout\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nconst template =

To use it, you must distribute a native\n`<input>` yourself. You can continue to use the native `input` as you would\nnormally:\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input type=\"email\" disabled>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Two-way binding\n\nBy default you can only get notified of changes to a native `<input>`'s `value`\ndue to user input:\n\n    <input value=\"{{myValue::input}}\">\n\nThis means that if you imperatively set the value (i.e. `someNativeInput.value =\n'foo'`), no events will be fired and this change cannot be observed.\n\n`iron-input` adds the `bind-value` property that mirrors the native `input`'s\n'`value` property; this property can be used for two-way data binding.\n`bind-value` will notify if it is changed either by user input or by script.\n\n    <iron-input bind-value=\"{{myValue}}\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\nNote: this means that if you want to imperatively set the native `input`'s, you\n_must_ set `bind-value` instead, so that the wrapper `iron-input` can be\nnotified.\n\n### Validation\n\n`iron-input` uses the native `input`'s validation. For simplicity, `iron-input`\nhas a `validate()` method (which internally just checks the distributed\n`input`'s validity), which sets an `invalid` attribute that can also be used for\nstyling.\n\nTo validate automatically as you type, you can use the `auto-validate`\nattribute.\n\n`iron-input` also fires an `iron-input-validate` event after `validate()` is\ncalled. You can use it to implement a custom validator:\n\n    var CatsOnlyValidator = {\n      validate: function(ironInput) {\n        var valid = !ironInput.bindValue || ironInput.bindValue === 'cat';\n        ironInput.invalid = !valid;\n        return valid;\n      }\n    }\n    ironInput.addEventListener('iron-input-validate', function() {\n      CatsOnly.validate(input2);\n    });\n\nYou can also use an element implementing an\n[`IronValidatorBehavior`](/element/PolymerElements/iron-validatable-behavior).\nThis example can also be found in the demo for this element:\n\n    <iron-input validator=\"cats-only\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Preventing invalid input\n\nIt may be desirable to only allow users to enter certain characters. You can use\nthe `allowed-pattern` attribute to accomplish this. This feature is separate\nfrom validation, and `allowed-pattern` does not affect how the input is\nvalidated.\n\n    // Only allow typing digits, but a valid input has exactly 5 digits.\n    <iron-input allowed-pattern=\"[0-9]\">\n      <input pattern=\"\\d{5}\">\n    </iron-input>\n\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: inline-block;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <slot id=\"content\"></slot>\n`,\n\n  is: 'iron-input',\n  behaviors: [IronValidatableBehavior],\n\n  /**\n   * Fired whenever `validate()` is called.\n   *\n   * @event iron-input-validate\n   */\n\n  properties: {\n\n    /**\n     * Use this property instead of `value` for two-way data binding, or to\n     * set a default value for the input. **Do not** use the distributed\n     * input's `value` property to set a default value.\n     */\n    bindValue: {type: String, value: ''},\n\n    /**\n     * Computed property that echoes `bindValue` (mostly used for Polymer 1.0\n     * backcompatibility, if you were one-way binding to the Polymer 1.0\n     * `input is=\"iron-input\"` value attribute).\n     */\n    value: {type: String, computed: '_computeValue(bindValue)'},\n\n    /**\n     * Regex-like list of characters allowed as input; all characters not in the\n     * list will be rejected.

You\ncan use `iron-meta` to share whatever you want (or create an extension [like\nx-meta] for enhancements).\n\nThe `iron-meta` instances containing your actual data can be loaded in an\nimport, or constructed in any way you see fit.

I could define more\nattributes or use child nodes to define additional metadata.\n\nNow I can access that element (and it's metadata) from any iron-meta instance\nvia the byKey method, e.g.\n\n    meta.byKey('info');\n\nPure imperative form would be like:\n\n    document.createElement('iron-meta').byKey('info');\n\nOr, in a Polymer element, you can include a meta in your template:\n\n    <iron-meta id=\"meta\"></iron-meta>\n    ...\n    this.$.meta.byKey('info');\n\n@group Iron Elements\n@demo demo/index.html\n@element iron-meta\n*/\nPolymer({\n\n  is: 'iron-meta',\n\n  properties: {\n\n    /**\n     * The type of meta-data.

other content. It includes an optional\n  backdrop, and can be used to implement a variety of UI controls including\n  dialogs and drop downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.\n\n  See the [demo source\n  code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.html)\n  for an example.\n\n  ### Closing and canceling\n\n  An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close\n  and cancel is user intent. Closing generally implies that the user\n  acknowledged the content on the overlay. By default, it will cancel whenever\n  the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is\n  configurable with the `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the\n  `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties. `close()` should be called explicitly\n  by the implementer when the user interacts with a control in the overlay\n  element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay fires an\n  'iron-overlay-canceled' event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to prevent\n  the overlay from closing.\n\n  ### Positioning\n\n  By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the\n  window. You can position and size it manually using CSS. See\n  `Polymer.IronFitBehavior`.\n\n  ### Backdrop\n\n  Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay.\n  The backdrop is appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`.\n  See its doc page for styling options.\n\n  In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the\n  light DOM. Override the [`_focusableNodes`\n  getter](#Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior:property-_focusableNodes) to achieve a\n  different behavior.\n\n  ### Limitations\n\n  The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its\n  `z-index` property. You must ensure no element has a stacking context with a\n  higher `z-index` than its parent stacking context. You should place this\n  element as a child of `<body>` whenever possible.\n\n  @demo demo/index.html\n  @polymerBehavior\n */\nexport const IronOverlayBehavior =\n    [IronFitBehavior, IronResizableBehavior, IronOverlayBehaviorImpl];\n\n/**\n * Fired after the overlay opens.\n * @event iron-overlay-opened\n */\n\n/**\n * Fired when the overlay is canceled, but before it is closed.\n * @event iron-overlay-canceled\n * @param {Event} event The closing of the overlay can be prevented\n * by calling `event.preventDefault()`.

It provides styles for a header, content\narea, and an action area for buttons. You can use the\n`<paper-dialog-scrollable>` element (in its own repository) if you need a\nscrolling content area. To autofocus a specific child element after opening the\ndialog, give it the `autofocus` attribute. See `Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior` and\n`Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior` for specifics.\n\nFor example, the following code implements a dialog with a header, scrolling\ncontent area and buttons. Focus will be given to the `dialog-confirm` button\nwhen the dialog is opened.\n\n    <paper-dialog>\n      <h2>Header</h2>\n      <paper-dialog-scrollable>\n        Lorem ipsum...\n      </paper-dialog-scrollable>\n      <div class=\"buttons\">\n        <paper-button dialog-dismiss>Cancel</paper-button>\n        <paper-button dialog-confirm autofocus>Accept</paper-button>\n      </div>\n    </paper-dialog>\n\n### Styling\n\nSee the docs for `Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior` for the custom properties\navailable for styling this element.\n\n### Animations\n\nSet the `entry-animation` and/or `exit-animation` attributes to add an animation\nwhen the dialog is opened or closed. See the documentation in\n[PolymerElements/neon-animation](https://github.com/PolymerElements/neon-animation)\nfor more info.\n\nFor example:\n\n    <script type=\"module\">\n      import '@polymer/neon-animation/animations/fade-out-animation.js';\n      import '@polymer/neon-animation/animations/scale-up-animation.js';\n    </script>\n\n    <paper-dialog entry-animation=\"scale-up-animation\"\n                  exit-animation=\"fade-out-animation\">\n      <h2>Header</h2>\n      <div>Dialog body</div>\n    </paper-dialog>\n\n### Accessibility\n\nSee the docs for `Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior` for accessibility features\nimplemented by this element.\n\n@group Paper Elements\n@element paper-dialog\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style include=\"paper-dialog-shared-styles\"></style>\n    <slot></slot>\n`,\n\n  is: 'paper-dialog',\n  behaviors: [PaperDialogBehavior, NeonAnimationRunnerBehavior],\n  listeners: {'neon-animation-finish': '_onNeonAnimationFinish'},\n\n  _renderOpened: function() {\n    this.cancelAnimation();\n    this.playAnimation('entry');\n  },\n\n  _renderClosed: function() {\n    this.cancelAnimation();\n    this.playAnimation('exit');\n  },\n\n  _onNeonAnimationFinish: function() {\n    if (this.opened) {\n      this._finishRenderOpened();\n    } else {\n      this._finishRenderClosed();\n    }\n  }\n});\n","/**\n@license\nCopyright (c) 2015 The Polymer Project Authors.

Doing so may cause events to bounce infinitely between\nthe container and its contained element.\n\n### Listening for input changes\n\nBy default, it listens for changes on the `bind-value` attribute on its children\nnodes and perform tasks such as auto-validating and label styling when the\n`bind-value` changes. You can configure the attribute it listens to with the\n`attr-for-value` attribute.\n\n### Using a custom input element\n\nYou can use a custom input element in a `<paper-input-container>`, for example\nto implement a compound input field like a social security number input. The\ncustom input element should have the `paper-input-input` class, have a\n`notify:true` value property and optionally implements\n`Polymer.IronValidatableBehavior` if it is validatable.\n\n    <paper-input-container attr-for-value=\"ssn-value\">\n      <label slot=\"label\">Social security number</label>\n      <ssn-input slot=\"input\" class=\"paper-input-input\"></ssn-input>\n    </paper-input-container>\n\n\nIf you're using a `<paper-input-container>` imperatively, it's important to make\nsure that you attach its children (the `iron-input` and the optional `label`)\nbefore you attach the `<paper-input-container>` itself, so that it can be set up\ncorrectly.\n\n### Validation\n\nIf the `auto-validate` attribute is set, the input container will validate the\ninput and update the container styling when the input value changes.\n\n### Add-ons\n\nAdd-ons are child elements of a `<paper-input-container>` with the `add-on`\nattribute and implements the `Polymer.PaperInputAddonBehavior` behavior. They\nare notified when the input value or validity changes, and may implement\nfunctionality such as error messages or character counters. They appear at the\nbottom of the input.\n\n### Prefixes and suffixes\nThese are child elements of a `<paper-input-container>` with the `prefix`\nor `suffix` attribute, and are displayed inline with the input, before or after.\n\n    <paper-input-container>\n      <div slot=\"prefix\">$</div>\n      <label slot=\"label\">Total</label>\n      <iron-input slot=\"input\">\n        <input>\n      </iron-input>\n      // In Polymer 1.0, you would use `<input is=\"iron-input\" slot=\"input\">`\ninstead of the above. <paper-icon-button slot=\"suffix\"\nicon=\"clear\"></paper-icon-button>\n    </paper-input-container>\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description |

The `item` property will be set on each instance's binding\n * scope, thus templates should bind to sub-properties of `item`.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <dom-module id=\"employee-list\">\n *\n *   <template>\n *\n *     <div> Employee list: </div>\n *     <dom-repeat items=\"{{employees}}\">\n *       <template>\n *         <div>First name: <span>{{item.first}}</span></div>\n *         <div>Last name: <span>{{item.last}}</span></div>\n *       </template>\n *     </dom-repeat>\n *\n *   </template>\n *\n * </dom-module>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following custom element definition:\n *\n * ```js\n * class EmployeeList extends PolymerElement {\n *   static get is() { return 'employee-list'; }\n *   static get properties() {\n *     return {\n *       employees: {\n *         value() {\n *           return [\n *             {first: 'Bob', last: 'Smith'},\n *             {first: 'Sally', last: 'Johnson'},\n *             ...\n *           ];\n *         }\n *       }\n *     };\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Notifications for changes to items sub-properties will be forwarded to template\n * instances, which will update via the normal structured data notification system.\n *\n * Mutations to the `items` array itself should be made using the Array\n * mutation API's on the PropertyEffects mixin (`push`, `pop`, `splice`,\n * `shift`, `unshift`), and template instances will be kept in sync with the\n * data in the array.\n *\n * Events caught by event handlers within the `dom-repeat` template will be\n * decorated with a `model` property, which represents the binding scope for\n * each template instance.  The model should be used to manipulate data on the\n * instance, for example `event.model.set('item.checked', true);`.\n *\n * Alternatively, the model for a template instance for an element stamped by\n * a `dom-repeat` can be obtained using the `modelForElement` API on the\n * `dom-repeat` that stamped it, for example\n * `this.$.domRepeat.modelForElement(event.target).set('item.checked', true);`.\n * This may be useful for manipulating instance data of event targets obtained\n * by event handlers on parents of the `dom-repeat` (event delegation).\n *\n * A view-specific filter/sort may be applied to each `dom-repeat` by supplying a\n * `filter` and/or `sort` property.  This may be a string that names a function on\n * the host, or a function may be assigned to the property directly.  The functions\n * should implemented following the standard `Array` filter/sort API.\n *\n * In order to re-run the filter or sort functions based on changes to sub-fields\n * of `items`, the `observe` property may be set as a space-separated list of\n * `item` sub-fields that should cause a re-filter/sort when modified.  If\n * the filter or sort function depends on properties not contained in `items`,\n * the user should observe changes to those properties and call `render` to update\n * the view based on the dependency change.\n *\n * For example, for an `dom-repeat` with a filter of the following:\n *\n * ```js\n * isEngineer(item) {\n *   return item.type == 'engineer' || item.manager.type == 'engineer';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Then the `observe` property should be configured as follows:\n *\n * ```html\n * <dom-repeat items=\"{{employees}}\" filter=\"isEngineer\" observe=\"type manager.type\">\n * ```\n *\n * @customElement\n * @polymer\n * @extends {domRepeatBase}\n * @appliesMixin OptionalMutableData\n * @summary Custom element for stamping instance of a template bound to\n *   items in an array.\n */\nexport class DomRepeat extends domRepeatBase {\n\n  // Not needed to find template; can be removed once the analyzer\n  // can find the tag name from customElements.define call\n  static get is() { return 'dom-repeat'; }\n\n  static get template() { return null; }\n\n  static get properties() {\n\n    /**\n     * Fired whenever DOM is added or removed by this template (by\n     * default, rendering occurs lazily).

Metadata objects on the `info` object\n * (`properties`, `observers`, `listeners`, `behaviors`, `is`) are used\n * for Polymer's meta-programming systems, and any functions are copied\n * to the generated class.\n *\n * Valid \"metadata\" values are as follows:\n *\n * `is`: String providing the tag name to register the element under. In\n * addition, if a `dom-module` with the same id exists, the first template\n * in that `dom-module` will be stamped into the shadow root of this element,\n * with support for declarative event listeners (`on-...`), Polymer data\n * bindings (`[[...]]` and `{{...}}`), and id-based node finding into\n * `this.$`.\n *\n * `properties`: Object describing property-related metadata used by Polymer\n * features (key: property names, value: object containing property metadata).\n * Valid keys in per-property metadata include:\n * - `type` (String|Number|Object|Array|...): Used by\n *   `attributeChangedCallback` to determine how string-based attributes\n *   are deserialized to JavaScript property values.\n * - `notify` (boolean): Causes a change in the property to fire a\n *   non-bubbling event called `<property>-changed`. Elements that have\n *   enabled two-way binding to the property use this event to observe changes.\n * - `readOnly` (boolean): Creates a getter for the property, but no setter.\n *   To set a read-only property, use the private setter method\n *   `_setProperty(property, value)`.\n * - `observer` (string): Observer method name that will be called when\n *   the property changes. The arguments of the method are\n *   `(value, previousValue)`.\n * - `computed` (string): String describing method and dependent properties\n *   for computing the value of this property (e.g. `'computeFoo(bar, zot)'`).\n *   Computed properties are read-only by default and can only be changed\n *   via the return value of the computing method.\n *\n * `observers`: Array of strings describing multi-property observer methods\n *  and their dependent properties (e.g. `'observeABC(a, b, c)'`).\n *\n * `listeners`: Object describing event listeners to be added to each\n *  instance of this element (key: event name, value: method name).\n *\n * `behaviors`: Array of additional `info` objects containing metadata\n * and callbacks in the same format as the `info` object here which are\n * merged into this element.\n *\n * `hostAttributes`: Object listing attributes to be applied to the host\n *  once created (key: attribute name, value: attribute value).  Values\n *  are serialized based on the type of the value.  Host attributes should\n *  generally be limited to attributes such as `tabIndex` and `aria-...`.\n *  Attributes in `hostAttributes` are only applied if a user-supplied\n *  attribute is not already present (attributes in markup override\n *  `hostAttributes`).\n *\n * In addition, the following Polymer-specific callbacks may be provided:\n * - `registered`: called after first instance of this element,\n * - `created`: called during `constructor`\n * - `attached`: called during `connectedCallback`\n * - `detached`: called during `disconnectedCallback`\n * - `ready`: called before first `attached`, after all properties of\n *   this element have been propagated to its template and all observers\n *   have run\n *\n * @param {!PolymerInit} info Object containing Polymer metadata and functions\n *   to become class methods.\n * @template T\n * @param {function(T):T} mixin Optional mixin to apply to legacy base class\n *   before extending with Polymer metaprogramming.\n * @return {function(new:HTMLElement)} Generated class\n */\nexport const Class = function(info, mixin) {\n  if (!info) {\n    console.warn('Polymer.Class requires `info` argument');\n  }\n  let klass = mixin ? mixin(LegacyElementMixin(HTMLElement)) :\n      LegacyElementMixin(HTMLElement);\n  klass = GenerateClassFromInfo(info, klass, info.behaviors);\n  // decorate klass with registration info\n  klass.is = klass.prototype.is = info.is;\n  return klass;\n};\n","/**\n@license\nCopyright (c) 2017 The Polymer Project Authors.

Instancing the class will result in the\n * template being stamped into a document fragment stored as the instance's\n * `root` property, after which it can be appended to the DOM.\n *\n * Templates may utilize all Polymer data-binding features as well as\n * declarative event listeners.  Event listeners and inline computing\n * functions in the template will be called on the host of the template.\n *\n * The constructor returned takes a single argument dictionary of initial\n * property values to propagate into template bindings.  Additionally\n * host properties can be forwarded in, and instance properties can be\n * notified out by providing optional callbacks in the `options` dictionary.\n *\n * Valid configuration in `options` are as follows:\n *\n * - `forwardHostProp(property, value)`: Called when a property referenced\n *   in the template changed on the template's host. As this library does\n *   not retain references to templates instanced by the user, it is the\n *   templatize owner's responsibility to forward host property changes into\n *   user-stamped instances.  The `instance.forwardHostProp(property, value)`\n *    method on the generated class should be called to forward host\n *   properties into the template to prevent unnecessary property-changed\n *   notifications. Any properties referenced in the template that are not\n *   defined in `instanceProps` will be notified up to the template's host\n *   automatically.\n * - `instanceProps`: Dictionary of property names that will be added\n *   to the instance by the templatize owner.  These properties shadow any\n *   host properties, and changes within the template to these properties\n *   will result in `notifyInstanceProp` being called.\n * - `mutableData`: When `true`, the generated class will skip strict\n *   dirty-checking for objects and arrays (always consider them to be\n *   \"dirty\").\n * - `notifyInstanceProp(instance, property, value)`: Called when\n *   an instance property changes.  Users may choose to call `notifyPath`\n *   on e.g. the owner to notify the change.\n * - `parentModel`: When `true`, events handled by declarative event listeners\n *   (`on-event=\"handler\"`) will be decorated with a `model` property pointing\n *   to the template instance that stamped it.  It will also be returned\n *   from `instance.parentModel` in cases where template instance nesting\n *   causes an inner model to shadow an outer model.\n *\n * All callbacks are called bound to the `owner`. Any context\n * needed for the callbacks (such as references to `instances` stamped)\n * should be stored on the `owner` such that they can be retrieved via\n * `this`.\n *\n * When `options.forwardHostProp` is declared as an option, any properties\n * referenced in the template will be automatically forwarded from the host of\n * the `<template>` to instances, with the exception of any properties listed in\n * the `options.instanceProps` object.  `instanceProps` are assumed to be\n * managed by the owner of the instances, either passed into the constructor\n * or set after the fact.  Note, any properties passed into the constructor will\n * always be set to the instance (regardless of whether they would normally\n * be forwarded from the host).\n *\n * Note that `templatize()` can be run only once for a given `<template>`.\n * Further calls will result in an error. Also, there is a special\n * behavior if the template was duplicated through a mechanism such as\n * `<dom-repeat>` or `<test-fixture>`. In this case, all calls to\n * `templatize()` return the same class for all duplicates of a template.\n * The class returned from `templatize()` is generated only once using\n * the `options` from the first call. This means that any `options`\n * provided to subsequent calls will be ignored. Therefore, it is very\n * important not to close over any variables inside the callbacks. Also,\n * arrow functions must be avoided because they bind the outer `this`.\n * Inside the callbacks, any contextual information can be accessed\n * through `this`, which points to the `owner`.\n *\n * @param {!HTMLTemplateElement} template Template to templatize\n * @param {Polymer_PropertyEffects=} owner Owner of the template instances;\n *   any optional callbacks will be bound to this owner.\n * @param {Object=} options Options dictionary (see summary for details)\n * @return {function(new:TemplateInstanceBase, Object=)} Generated class bound\n *   to the template provided\n * @suppress {invalidCasts}\n */\nexport function templatize(template, owner, options) {\n  // Under strictTemplatePolicy, the templatized element must be owned\n  // by a (trusted) Polymer element, indicated by existence of _methodHost;\n  // e.g. for dom-if & dom-repeat in main document, _methodHost is null\n  if (strictTemplatePolicy && !findMethodHost(template)) {\n    throw new Error('strictTemplatePolicy: template owner not trusted');\n  }\n  options = /** @type {!TemplatizeOptions} */(options || {});\n  if (template.__templatizeOwner) {\n    throw new Error('A <template> can only be templatized once');\n  }\n  template.__templatizeOwner = owner;\n  const ctor = owner ? owner.constructor : TemplateInstanceBase;\n  let templateInfo = ctor._parseTemplate(template);\n  // Get memoized base class for the prototypical template, which\n  // includes property effects for binding template & forwarding\n  /**\n   * @constructor\n   * @extends {TemplateInstanceBase}\n   */\n  let baseClass = templateInfo.templatizeInstanceClass;\n  if (!baseClass) {\n    baseClass = createTemplatizerClass(template, templateInfo, options);\n    templateInfo.templatizeInstanceClass = baseClass;\n  }\n  // Host property forwarding must be installed onto template instance\n  addPropagateEffects(template, templateInfo, options);\n  // Subclass base class and add reference for this specific template\n  /** @private */\n  let klass = class TemplateInstance extends baseClass {};\n  /** @override */\n  klass.prototype._methodHost = findMethodHost(template);\n  /** @override */\n  klass.prototype.__dataHost = /** @type {!DataTemplate} */ (template);\n  /** @override */\n  klass.prototype.__templatizeOwner = /** @type {!Object} */ (owner);\n  /** @override */\n  klass.prototype.__hostProps = templateInfo.hostProps;\n  klass = /** @type {function(new:TemplateInstanceBase)} */(klass); //eslint-disable-line no-self-assign\n  return klass;\n}\n\n/**\n * Returns the template \"model\" associated with a given element, which\n * serves as the binding scope for the template instance the element is\n * contained in.

This is accomplished by changing the property set to this:\n *\n *    --foo_-_border: 2px solid red;\n *    --foo_-_color: initial;\n *    --foo_-_background: initial;\n *\n * This works but introduces one new issue.\n * Consider this setup at the point where the `@apply` is used:\n *\n *    background: orange;\n *    `@apply` --foo;\n *\n * In this case the background will be unset (initial) rather than the desired\n * `orange`. We address this by altering the property set to use a fallback\n * value like this:\n *\n *    color: var(--foo_-_color);\n *    background: var(--foo_-_background, orange);\n *    border: var(--foo_-_border);\n *\n * Note that the default is retained in the property set and the `background` is\n * the desired `orange`. This leads us to a limitation.\n *\n * Limitation 1:\n\n * Only properties in the rule where the `@apply`\n * is used are considered as default values.\n * If another rule matches the element and sets `background` with\n * less specificity than the rule in which `@apply` appears,\n * the `background` will not be set.\n *\n * Limitation 2:\n *\n * When using Polymer's `updateStyles` api, new
